# Awesome Books: with ES6.

In this project, I took the Awesome books application and converted it into a fully functional website. I refactored the project to add three new sections on top of the two sections we have already completed: Books list (done), Add book form (done), a new Contact info section, a Navigation bar, and a Footer.
